      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hello! I’m <strong>Varun Naudiyal</strong> — a 4th year physics major. 
        My primary interests lie in <strong>compact object astrophysics</strong>, where all branches of physics converge to reveal some of the most extraordinary phenomena in nature. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy exploring <strong>Einstein’s General Relativity</strong>, and compact objects serve as natural laboratories for testing its limits. 
        My current interests include computational simulations of astrophysical events such as neutron star and black hole mergers,
        as well as the emerging field of multi-messenger astronomy. I’m also exploring the use of Machine Learning and 
        Neural Networks to model and analyze physical processes in these extreme environments.
