      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hello! I’m <strong>Varun Naudiyal</strong> — a 4th year physics major. My primary interests lie in <strong>compact object astrophysics</strong>.
        I enjoy exploring <strong>Einstein’s General Relativity</strong>, and compact objects serve as natural laboratories for testing its limits. 
        My current interests include computational simulations of astrophysical events such as neutron star and black hole mergers. I’m also exploring
        the use of Machine Learning to model and analyze physical processes in these extreme environments.

        This site is a space to showcase my projects and chronicle my journey in this field. Through my blog, I will be sharing all the 
        fascinating concepts I have learnt (Hopefully in a manner that won't bore the reader to death) :3
