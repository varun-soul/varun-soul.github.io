I know — it sounds pretty barbaric, right? The name might conjure up images of blood and destruction, but for us, a *Killing field* is quite the opposite. It’s not a destroyer, but a preserver. Before we get into what that means, let’s start with the notion of  what actually is a "Symmetry".
## Symmetry :

I talked about self diffeomorphisms earlier and how they were akin to us distorting the manifold without tearing it or gluing it. But when we do this what happens to the tensor fields we have defined on the manifolds?

A self diffeomorphism $\phi$ is called a symmetry of some tensor field $T$ if the following holds :
$$
\phi^* T = T
$$
Symmetries need not be discrete. We talked about how vector fields have flows and are generators of one-parameter families of diffeomorphisms. This is where our continuous symmetries come into play. We can define such a symmetry using the following condition :
$$
\mathcal{L}_{V} T = 0
$$
