I know — it sounds pretty barbaric, right? The name might conjure up images of blood and destruction, but for us, a *Killing field* is quite the opposite. It’s not a destroyer, but a preserver. Before we get into what that means, let’s first get some of the pesky prerequisites out of the way.
## Self-Diffeomorphisms :

Consider two manifolds $M$ and $N$, with a smooth map $\phi$ between them. A **diffeomorphism** is a map $\phi$ that has an inverse which is also smooth. 

But what does this really mean, intuitively?

Think of a spherical surface and the surface of a potato. Surprisingly, these two surfaces can be connected through a diffeomorphism — in other words, they are *diffeomorphic* to each other. On the level of manifolds, they are essentially the same object, just smoothly deformed.

Now, what happens when the diffeomorphism is a **self-diffeomorphism**?

It’s a smooth, invertible deformation that keeps the manifold’s structure intact but possibly “rearranges” its points. You can think of it as a way of smoothly reshaping the manifold without tearing, gluing, or adding anything new. 

Consider the following example:

We have a representative flat surface as our manifold $M$. A diffeomorphism to itself preserves its structure *but* shifts the points on the manifold. The plane has been reshaped without tearing, gluing or adding anything new. 

Another example would be a 2-sphere (spherical surface). A rotation of the 2-sphere is also considered a self-diffeomorphism. All the points on that manifold are smoothly shifted under its action.
