          <h2>1. Neutron Stars in Modified Gravity</h2>
          <p>
            In this project, I worked with the Compact Object Astrophysics Group in my college (COAST) and studied modified gravity and how 
            the equations for neutron stars (TOV) behave in this framework. I analyzed the case for 
            R² gravity, where we added an αR² term to the action.

          <h2>2. Oppenheimer-Snyder Collapse</h2>
          <p>
            This is an ongoing project for my GR course. Here I aim to explore the spherical collapse of matter into a blackhole. I will begin
            by exploring the simplest such model, the Oppenheimer Snyder Collapse before moving onto complex generalizations. One of the end goals
            of this project is to try and simulate this collapse using GR1D, a 1D spherically symmetric simulation software for General Relativistic
            simulations. You can read more about it in my blog :D
