          <h2>1. Neutron Stars in Modified Gravity</h2>
          <p>
          I worked with the Compact Object Astrophysics Group (COAST) at my college, where 
          I explored the effects of modified gravity on the structure of neutron stars. 
          The project focused on studying how the TOV equations are altered in 
          alternative theories of gravity. In particular, I analyzed the case of R<sup>2</sup>
          gravity by introducing an αR<sup>2</sup> term to the Einstein–Hilbert action and 
          examined how this modification influences the mass–radius relationship and stability 
          of neutron stars. 

          This was a pretty interesting project which certainly helped broaden my horizons. Currently
          I am working on numerically solving the TOV equations in order to see the evolution of the Ricci Scalar
          outside the stellar surface. Unlike in standard GR, Birkhoff's theorem is no longer valid!!!

          <h2>2. Oppenheimer-Snyder Collapse</h2>
          <p>
            This is an ongoing project for my General Relativity course under Dr. Ritam Mallick at IISERB. Here we are trying
            to explore one of the first ever physical descriptions of collapse into a blackhole. I am currently trying to work
            my way through Oppenheimer and Snyder's paper. I will be talking about this fascinating topic on my blog. I would 
            also try to simulate this scenario using GR1D, a 1D General-Relativistic simulation software.

          <h2>3. Numerical Relativity</h2>
          <p>
            This is a slightly ambitious pet project of mine. I have always been fascinated simulations of black-holes and 
            neutron stars mergers and always wanted to give them a try myself. Currently I'm going through the first few 
            chapters of Baumgarte's book on NR (a great book btw!! he also has a lecture series from ICTS on youtube).
